# Advanced Network Scripts

This repository contains a collection of advanced network scripts that can be used in larger companies to manage and monitor networks. These scripts provide automation, monitoring, and configuration capabilities to handle complex network environments.

## Scripts Included

1. **Network Traffic Analysis Script**: Captures network traffic using tcpdump and analyzes it using tshark. Useful for monitoring network traffic patterns, detecting anomalies, and identifying potential security threats.

2. **Bandwidth Usage Monitoring Script**: Monitors the bandwidth usage of specific network interfaces and generates reports at regular intervals. Helpful for tracking bandwidth consumption trends, identifying high-traffic periods, and optimizing network resources.

3. **Network Configuration Automation Script**: Automates the configuration of network devices using the Expect scripting language. Enables streamlined network device provisioning, automated tasks, and consistent network configurations.

4. **Network Service Monitoring Script**: Monitors the availability of network services by periodically sending requests and checking the response status. Useful for proactive detection of service disruptions, generating alerts, and ensuring service uptime.
