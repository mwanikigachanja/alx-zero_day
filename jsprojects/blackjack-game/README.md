## Description

Blackjack Game is a simple command-line implementation of the popular card game Blackjack, also known as 21. The game allows a single player to play against the computerized dealer. The objective of the game is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player who gets the closest to 21 without busting wins the round.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine (tested on Node.js version X.X.X).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
3. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt.
4. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the game by running the following command:

   ```
   node blackjack.js
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. You will be dealt two cards at the beginning. You can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to end your turn. The dealer will then play its turn, and the game will announce the result.

7. Enjoy the game!
